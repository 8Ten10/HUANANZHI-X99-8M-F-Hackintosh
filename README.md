This repository contains my EFI configuration for my custom build.

This is a multiboot system, with each OS (`Mac OS 14.0 Sonoma`, `Windows 11`, `RedHat 9.1`) running on its own storage device. 

[Opencore 0.9.4](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) is the most recent version deployed.

The guide is based on my personal experience and Dortania's Doc.

I would recommend upgrading the BIOS if it is not on the more recent version [FROM THE OFFICIAL SUPPORT PAGE](http://www.huananzhi.com/html/1/184/185/551.html)

A few information (Serial Number, MLB, ROM...) has been naturally obfuscated. Update your `Config.plist` accordingly.

## MISCELLANEOUS

As I mentioned earlier, I followed [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) as my main reference. 

Keep in mind that your build might be different from mine because of all different components. Follow the guide accordingly. 

My CPU is `Haswell E` so I followed [this PART of the guide](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/ssdt-methods/ssdt-prebuilt.html#haswell-and-broadwell-e) . You could use Prebuilt SSDTs, it will work but will also make your system boot slowly because of way too many bloats. I would recommend doing it manually (compiling and decompoling) or using an automated tool such as SSDTTime.

Always do a `Clean Snapshot` (Cmd+Shift+R) with Propertree after making any change in the EFI folder.


## POST INSTALL VOLUME PATCH

**Update**

/// I recently upgraded my GPU to a RX 580. So this step is not anymore applicable in my case. However, I will let it remain up. It might come handy for someone else. ///



`ONLY APPLY THIS PATCH IF YOU ARE RUNNING ON MAC OS 12 MONTEREY!!`

Unfortunalely, Apple has dropped native support for `Kepler dGPUs` (600 - 800 series) on Monterey. The GT 710 being one of them, the only option available to get graphic acceleration is to patch the OS with some specific tools. Remember that this only necessary if you are running `Monterey and up`. It is still natively supported on any OS below Monterey.

I used [OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP)](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) , but [Geforce Kepler patcher](https://github.com/chris1111/Geforce-Kepler-patcher) from `Christ1111` is another good option. They both install Nvidia binaries files for macOS Monterey. The choice is yours.
> - Dowload [OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP)](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases)
> - Disable SIP with this value `EF0F0000` in `csr-active-config`
> - Open the app
> - Hit on `Post Install Root Patcher`
> - It should automatically detects which patch is available for the system, in my case, `Nvidia Kepler`.
> - Hit on `Start Root Patching` and reboot the system.

## SETTING UP OPENCORE GUI

![multiboot](images/28160023.png)

You could get Opencore to look nicer. [THEMES ARE FULLY SUPPORTED.](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/cosmetic/gui.html#setting-up-opencore-s-gui) 

The theme I use is called `Antebellum` and can be grabbed from here https://github.com/canemdormienti/Opencore-Opencanopy-Themes/tree/main/Antebellum

A few things to change to get everything to work properly:

> - Add `OpenCanopy.efi` to `EFI/OC/Drivers`
> - In `Misc`, change -> Boot -> PickerMode: `External` 
> - In `Misc`, change -> Boot -> PickerAttributes: `144`
> - In `Misc`, change -> Boot -> Pickervariant: `canemdormienti\Antebellum`

I have it included in my EFI folder if you decide to use it.
